Did you have any pets growing up? What kind? What were their name? I had two pets when I was very little in Mexico. One cat named "Luna", which means moon and a dog named "Lobo", which means wolf.
If you could travel anywhere in the world for ONE WEEK, where would you go? I would go to Barbados.
If you could live anywhere in the world for a YEAR, where would you want to live? I would live in Japan. 
where would you go and what would you do? My perfect night would be a wonderful dinner at a Thai food restaurant, followed by a nice dessert.
Afterwards, change into comfy clothes and read a book with a hot cup of chocolate, tea, or coffee.
